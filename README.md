# flare

This repository contains the source of https://github.com/flareteam/flare-engine and https://github.com/flareteam/flare-game. I added the needed SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer and SDL2_ttf dependencies and also wrote a small description on how to build it on windows. By my own I used Visual Studio 2015.

It should be clear that the Copyright of flare and of all it's dependencies not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.
